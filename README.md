# i-know-design-patterns

## Overview

`i-know-design-patterns` is a project dedicated to mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and design patterns. The main objective is to explore, solve, and document various questions and problems related to design patterns, ultimately proving a comprehensive understanding of these concepts.

## Project Goals

- **Understand Design Patterns**: Deep dive into commonly used design patterns and their applications in real-world scenarios.
- **Solve Design Pattern Challenges**: Address and solve practical problems using appropriate design patterns.
- **Demonstrate Proficiency**: Show a thorough grasp of design patterns by providing clear solutions and explanations.

## Design Patterns Covered

This project explores a range of design patterns, including but not limited to:

- **Creational Patterns**: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
- **Structural Patterns**: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/i-know-design-patterns.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd i-know-design-patterns
    ```

3. **Explore the Code**: Review the implementation of various design patterns in the `src` directory.

4. **Run Tests**: Execute the tests to see how different patterns solve specific problems.
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
